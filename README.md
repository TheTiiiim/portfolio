# Portfolio

This repository is my submission for my UNH coding bootcamp's second homework assignment.
The goal of this assignment was to utilize bootstrap to create a responsive portfolio site.

After creating the general layout of  `index.html`, the other pages were as simple as replacing the content within the `main` element.

I utilized bootstrap's grid system to have the main content stay towards the left of the screen, and to organize the gallary in `portfolio.html`.
I decided to float the image in `index.html` on larger screen widths to keep the flow of the text wrapping around it.

The deployed project can be viewed [here](https://thetiiiim.github.io/portfolio/)

*note that the background in this screenshot is broken, the background remains fixed as the page scrolls, and the tool I used to screenshot couldn't capture that effect
